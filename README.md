## Theme

- **Education** : The widely revered education system of India is still primarily based on grades which undermines the co-curricular skills of students and thus is a very superficial measure of one’s capabilities. Develop a scholastic system which focuses on the all-round capabilities of students and is not uni-dimensional.

## Problem Statements

- EDU-WUAL-01

In today’s new normal, it’s really impossible to go outside and explore opportunities to visit tutors and learn. There are millions of tutors who are unable to generate more revenue and are unable to utilise their full potential. On the other hand, students also are facing challenges due to not being able to learn from the tutor which would be a best fit for them. Building AI driven platforms (web/mobile) could be a great approach to connect students with relevant sets of tutors. (Please note that tutors are not limited to exam prep tutoring but stands still for vocational courses like music, dance, or coding as well)
